# NURS7701 Writing Expectations & Short Readings About Scholarly Writing

Here are some key points to remember while you're writing and before submitting assignments:

* Download and install the Grammarly add-in.
* Address the issues in your writing that Grammarly identifies. (Assignments that have multiple spelling or grammar errors or that have problems with clarity and conciseness will be sent back to you for correction before grading.)
* Assess how well you have addressed the content for each section with AI before submitting your assignments. If you have missed certain content, address it before submitting your assignment.

I've created a short list of readings to reinforce some principles of effective scholarly writing. They're all short, just a couple of pages. They're split out week by week. By the end of the semester, you'll have read them all. They talk about the kinds of things I look for in scholarly writing. My hope is to get us all on the same page when it comes to writing your papers next semester. I attended a writing workshop held by George Gopen at the University of Utah in 2023. While these articles are addressed to a legal audience, the same principles apply to scholarly writing in the sciences.

## Get ready for writing next semester

* Skim through my writing page: https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents
* You don't need to go to all of the links. You can go to the links in any areas of writing you personally find problematic.
* Pay particular attention to how I highlight papers when I'm evaluating the writing. I'll be doing that type of highlighting on your papers next semester. https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents#here-are-the-things-im-looking-for
